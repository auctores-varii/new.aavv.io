<i> 100 years of history does not represent much in the history of humanity, much less in the history of the Earth,
 but the last 100 years in Russia have been the key in understanding the future of Eastern Europe and the world in general, notwithstanding, historians -like Eric Hobsbawm- have considered the end of the Soviet Union as the end of the Contemporary Age. 

Today, can we really understand these changes?

<p> To avoid going into the analysis of the political regimes that have governed the country during the given period, the article will focus on the destinies of mere citizens. 
Here I would like to follow the examples of other journalists who aimed only to report what they saw. For instance, John Reed wrote in his book Ten days that shook the World during the October Revolution 100 years ago 
“This book is a slice of intensified history as I saw it.
 It does not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the November Revolution, when the Bolsheviks, at the head of the workers and soldiers, seized the state power of Russia and placed it in the hands of the Soviets”. </p>
