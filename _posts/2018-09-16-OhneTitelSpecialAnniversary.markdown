## **A semi-serious reflection of an event/incident**

---

I was looking at recording and reproducing the sounds of the Salix; within his context. A conversation listening to the tree and telling about its roots. 

I ended up imaging the soundscape/picture of a similar Sunday morning, with the tree and families.

  
  


The location, I tought, it would have required my blending into the tree and the sound coming from the woods.

Little I knew about how much I'd be blending in the soundscape.
   
   
    
It is fun to think how an accident can be possible be giving some inspirations. ~~Or rework backwards artistic intentions.~~





To setup a conversation with the tree, one need to get to known his sounds, of his soundscape, of his "rugosita".
  

I blended in the woods.
  
  
The performance started, anonymous, undetectable




A silent conversation, without anyone noticing it. Even me! a so silent conversation I had trouble to detect.

The noise of each Sunday merge,  bird voice become squicky, waters become obsessives.

just tree augmented reality.
